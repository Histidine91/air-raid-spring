 - Fixed controls being wrong after an Immelmann/split-S
 - There are now four game modes: Raid (classic), Dogfight (PvP), Dogfight Plus (includes the neutral enemies of Raid), and Intercept (10-wave survival air-to-air combat)
 - Nerfed cannnon a bit (still shreds pretty much anything with a good burst)

---------------------
Air Raid v1.3
---------------------
 - Changed the missile effects a little
 - Reduced MRM maneuverability, increased AAM's, should make AAMs more important in air combat.
 - Controls moved into a widget, also includes two other widgets (inverted Y axis and pointer control). Potentially reduces network traffic as well.
 - Enemy airplanes will now do attack runs on the player instead of clumping around him, should allow both sides to get more attacks in.
 - Missiles no longer cause craters so you won't have FLAKs buried in craters anymore.
